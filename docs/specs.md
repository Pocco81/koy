### General Structure

Like JSON, `key -> values` are the foundation of everything. The general structure is the following one:

```
key: value
```

> notice the space between the `:` and the `value`.

#### Keys

<details>
    <summary>Keys can only contain ASCII letters and underscores <code>(A-Za-z0-9_)</code></summary>

```
key: "value"
key_1: "value"
2001: "value"

// invalid keys
my-key: "value"
‡Æá‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Ææ: "value"
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Literal keys must be specified using backticks</summary>

```
`mainland!tv.◊ß◊ï◊ù`: "value"
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Keys cannot be empty</summary>

```
: "value" //invalid
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Keys cannot be duplicated</summary>

```
hello: "world"
hello: "momma!"
```

</details>

#### Values

Values can have any of the following data types:

-   Integer
-   String
-   Null
-   Array
-   Boolean
-   Float
-   Object

&nbsp;

### Comments

Comments are an integral part of any program, that's why you've got two ways to use them:

```
// single-line comment here!

/*
  multi-line comment
*/
```

&nbsp;

### Data Types

A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error. On Koy files they are inferred, however they can still be specified and values can be converted according to your needs.

#### Specifying/Converting Data Types

Data types can be specified using two exclamation marks (`!!`) and then the desired type before the `value`. It will convert the incoming value if needed:

```
num1: !!int 1.0		// converted to 1
num2: !!float 100	// converted to 100.0
num3: !!str 150		// converted to "150"
```

#### Integer `(int)`

Integers contain whole numbers:

-   Integers can simply be whole numbers
-   Positive numbers may be prefixed with a `+`
-   Negative numbers are prefixed with a `-`
-   Large numbers can be separeted using underscores (`_`) to enhance readability. The only condition is that they must be surrounded by at least one digit on each side

```
i1: -35
i2: 0
i3: +104
i4: 201
i5: 2_005
```

#### String `(str)`

Strings contain alphanumeric characters:

-   Any Unicode character may be escaped with the \uXXXX or \UXXXXXXXX forms. The escape codes must be valid Unicode scalar values.
-   Basic strings are surrounded by quotation marks ("). Any Unicode character may be used except those that must be escaped: quotation mark, backslash, and the control characters other than tab (U+0000 to U+0008, U+000A to U+001F, U+007F).

```
hello: "world!\nYou may call me \"Jeff\""
```

For convenience, some popular characters have a compact escape sequence.

```
\b         - backspace       (U+0008)
\t         - tab             (U+0009)
\n         - linefeed        (U+000A)
\f         - form feed       (U+000C)
\r         - carriage return (U+000D)
\"         - quote           (U+0022)
\\         - backslash       (U+005C)
\uXXXX     - unicode         (U+XXXX)
\UXXXXXXXX - unicode         (U+XXXXXXXX)
```

-   Multi-line basic strings are surrounded by three quotation marks on each side and allow newlines. A newline immediately following the opening delimiter will be trimmed. All other whitespace and newline characters remain intact.

```
str1 = """
Roses are red
Violets are blue"""
```

-   For writing long strings without introducing extraneous whitespace, use a "line ending backslash". When the last non-whitespace character on a line is an unescaped \, it will be trimmed along with all whitespace (including newlines) up to the next non-whitespace character or closing delimiter. All of the escape sequences that are valid for basic strings are also valid for multi-line basic strings.

```
// The following strings are byte-for-byte equivalent
str1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

str2: """
The quick brown \


  fox jumps over \
    the lazy dog"""

str3: """\
       The quick brown \
       fox jumps over \
       the lazy dog.\
       """
```

-   You can write a quotation mark, or two adjacent quotation marks, anywhere inside a multi-line basic string. They can also be written just inside the delimiters.

```
str4: """Here are two quotation marks: "". Simple enough."""
str5: """Here are three quotation marks: """."""  // invalid
str5: """Here are three quotation marks: ""\"."""
str6: """Here are fifteen quotation marks: ""\"""\"""\"""\"""\"."""
```

#### Null `(null)`

-   Use the keyword `null`

```
key: null
```

#### Array `(arr)`

-   Arrays are declared using brackets (`{}`)
-   Elements are separated by commas (`,`), except for the last one
-   Empty arrays can be declared by leaving the brackets empty
-   Arrays can contain values of different types
-   They can be nested

```
environment: {
	term: "linux",
	histsize: 5000,
	theme: "light",
	package_manage: "pacman"
}

nested_array: {
	{ 1, 0, 1 },
	{ "h", "a", "l" , "l", "o" }
}

friends: {}
```

#### Boolean `(bool)`

-   must be either `true` or `false`

```
has_children: true
likes_pineapple: false
```

#### Float `(float)`

Floating points contain numbers with a decimal points:

-   They must be implemented as IEEE 754 binary64 values
-   The decimal point, if used, must be surrounded by at least one digit on each side.
-   A float consists of an integer part followed by a fractional part
-   Positive floats may be prefixed with a `+`
-   Negative floats are prefixed with a `-`

```
f0: -0.00001
f1: +34.0
f2: 2.71828
```

#### Object `(bool)`

Objects are used to represent ‚Äúthings‚Äù with characteristics (AKA properties):

-   Objects are declared using squared brackets (`[]`)
-   Empty objects can be declared leaving the brackets empty

```
user: [
	name: "Michael Theodor Mouse",
	age: 34,
	married: false
]

spouse: []
```

&nbsp;

### Imports

Imports are statements used to "bring in" other `.koy` files:

-   The effect of importing a file is the same as replacing the import by the file's contents. Therefore, all the keys and variables defined on them will be available in the file which is importing
-   Single imports are done using only the `import` keyword
-   Multiple imports can be place inside of curly braces (`{}`) next to an `import` statement

```
// single import example
import "./directory/my_config.koy"

// multiple imports
import {
	"./directory/user0.koy",
	"./directory/user1.koy",
	"./directory/user2.koy"
}
```

&nbsp;

### Variables

Everything in a `.koy` file is a variable:

-   They can be accessed using `${}`

```
name: "Michael Theodor Mouse"
hello: "Good evening ${name}"
```

-   Variables within an array/object can be accessed using the `.` notation

```
user: [
	name: "Michael",
	surnames: "Theodor Mouse"
]
hi: "Good morning ${user.name}"
```

-   The value of a variable can be overwritten using `<<`

```
hello: "world"
another_hello: ${hello} << "momma!" // notice that hello is still equal to "world"

mouse: "Mickey" << "Minnie"
```

-   When using `<<` on an array or an object, it will replace its fields

```
// object
user: [
	name: "Michael Theodor Mouse",
	age: 93
]

// array
ports: { 8000, 8001, 8002 }

laptop: {
	name: "Lenovo Thinkpad",
	owner: ${user} << [
		name: "Dominic Toretto"
	],
	ports: ${ports} << { 2: 8007 }
}
```

> Note: you are not overwritting the variable you are calling, you are replacing the value of the incoming variable or the one you are assigning itself (third example, fourth line). On arrays/objects you are simply overwriting fields, not the whole array/object.
